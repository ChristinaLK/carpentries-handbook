## Maintainer Guidelines

Carpentry Maintainers work with the community to make sure that lessons stay up-to-date, accurate, functional and cohesive. They monitor
their lesson repository, make sure that PRs and Issues are addressed in a timely manner, and participate in the lesson development cycle
including lesson releases. They endeavor to be welcoming and supportive of contributions from all members of the community. 

Maintainers are responsible for:
 - Routinely:
    - Ensuring reasonable response time to all submitted Issues and PRs. At a minimum, ensuring all Issues and PRs are acknowledged within two days.
    - Quickly addressing issues and PRs tagged as “bug”s. 
    - Submitting Issues as they arise.
    - Adhering to the Code of Conduct and alerting the Policy Subcommittee to any potential violations.
    - Identifying potential new Maintainers based on their review activity.

- Every six months: 
    - Participating in regular Issue Bonanza and Bug BBQ events, including organizing and tagging issues. 
    - Bringing in updates to the lesson template.

Maintainers represent the Carpentry community and should strive to embody the Carpentry philosophy, by:
- Recognizing the importance of communication and being welcoming to all contributors.
- Giving feedback to contributors using the Carpentries model:
    - Find what’s good. Be specific about improvements needed. Use motivational language.
- Evaluating lesson contributions in light of Carpentries pedagogical model:
    - Teach what’s most relevant and useful for learners.
    - Avoid getting bogged down in technical details.
    - Keep language motivating. 
    - Emphasize the importance of continued learning and improvement.

Note: These guidelines are adapted from those currently in use by the Data Carpentry Genomics Maintainers and are provisional. The Maintainer team will be deciding on official guidelines for the full set of Software and Data Carpentry Maintainers. 


## Maintainer Onboarding

New Maintainers go through an onboarding process. The curriculum for 
onboarding new Maintainers is available as a 
[Maintainer Onboarding Lesson](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/). 
This documentation describes how new Maintainers are recruited and taken through
the onboarding process. 

1) The application to become a Maintainer is [a Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuSUffza_DrqqMwdokdNtSgNfdxzMSmbwLw8655GU31BXPyg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

2) New Maintainers are adverstised for on the blog, mailing lists and Twitter. 

3) Once the application period has closed, applications are reviewed and accepted applicants are sent an [invitation](email_templates.html#inviting-new-maintainers) to become a Maintainer.

4) A scheduling poll to schedule Maintainer Onboarding is set up using [WhenIsGood](http://whenisgood.net/). Click "Use Timezones" and then "SHOW OPTIONS". Unselect Sunday and Saturday. Add Duration = 60 minutes. Select "hide dates".

5) Maintainers who are going through training are added to the [maintainer-onboarding Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/carpentries.org/forum/#!forum/maintainer-onboarding). This is where announcements about upcoming meetings should be sent.

6) After the deadline has passed for responding to the Maintainer Onboarding scheduling poll, two times are selected to maximize attendance. This needs to be done manually from the whenisgood results, as there isn't a "choose two times" option.

7) The [Maintainer onboarding Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainer-onboarding) is populated with meeting dates and times. [Timeanddate meeting time announcer](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedform.html) links are used to make it easy for people to convert meeting times to their own time zone.

8) An [email](email_templates.html#maintainer-onboarding-meetings) is sent out to the Google Group letting everyone know about the scheduling. 

9) A [new event in AMY](../workshop_administration/amy_manual.html#adding-a-new-event) is set up with the slug YEAR-MO-DA-maintainer-onboarding. All maintainer trainees are added as learners, and the onboarding leader is added as instructor. 

10) One week before the first onboarding meeting, a reminder [email](email_templates.html#onboarding-reminder) is sent to the Google Group. 

11) The three weeks of meetings are run according to [the curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/). Records need to be kept of who participates in the AMY event.

12) If people are not able to make all of the meetings, an [email](email_templates.html#missed-onboarding-meeting) is sent to ask them to write out responses to the discussion questions and homeworks. 

13) After the final onboarding meeting, the following needs to be done for each of the Maintainers who have completed the onboarding requirements:  
    - Give them "write" access to their lesson repository on GitHub. 
    - Add their name is added to the lesson table on the website.
    - Award them a Maintainer badge in AMY.

14) An [email](email_templates.html#welcoming-new-maintainers) is sent to the Maintainers email list announcing new Maintainers.

15) Run sendmail_maintainer_certificates.R to send new Maintainers their certificates.

16) New Maintainers are announced in the next newsletter.

## How to stay in touch 

The overall Maintainer community communicates using our [mailing list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/listinfo/maintainers) and our [Slack channel](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/messages/C8H5LN44V/details/). If you don't already have a Slack account with the Carpentries, you can [create one](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

The Maintainer community meets monthly to discuss issues relevant to all lesson Maintainers. Our meeting schedule can be found on [our Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainers) and on the [community calendar](https://software-carpentry.org/join/#calendar).

Each Lesson Team also has their own Slack channel. A link to join your lesson's Slack channel can be found
in the README file in your lesson repository. 

## How to handle issues

Information coming soon. 

## How to get help

There are many ways to request help on an issue or PR you are reviewing. To get help from other Maintainers or the general community, use the `status:help-wanted` or `status:need-contributor` labels.

If an issue affects the overall structure or scope of the lesson, you can refer the issue to your curriculum's [Curriculum Advisory Subcommittee](http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/lesson_development_roles.html#curriculum-advisory-committee) by using the `status:refer-to-cac` label. Remember that the Curriculum Advisors only meet once every six months (in advance of lesson releases) and they will likely not be able to provide a quick response to your question.

You can also get help from other Maintainers and interested community members by posting a question to your lesson's Slack channel. 

## How to suggest changes to the styling for all lessons

Information coming soon.
